# Isotopes and Coulombâ€™s Law

## Isotopes

**Isotopes** are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

- They have **identical chemical properties**.
- Their **mass numbers differ**, which affects nuclear stability and mass.

### Example: Carbon Isotopes

- $Carbon\text{-}12$ has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
- $Carbon\text{-}14$ has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (used in radiocarbon dating).

> ðŸ’¡ Isotopes play an important role in nuclear chemistry and dating techniques.

## Coulombâ€™s Law

Coulombâ€™s Law describes the **electrostatic force** between two charged particles.

$$
F = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
$$

Where:

- $F$ is the electrostatic force
- $k$ is Coulombâ€™s constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2$)
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges
- $r$ is the distance between them

### Key Insight

- **Attractive force** between opposite charges
- **Repulsive force** between like charges
- As **distance increases**, force **decreases** dramatically

## Connection Between the Two

Even though **isotopes** are neutral overall, their **nuclear structure affects atomic radius**, which can slightly change **interatomic distances** in chemical bonding. This in turn can influence the **strength of electrostatic attractions** (e.g. ion-dipole or lattice energies).

In **ion formation**, Coulombâ€™s Law explains:

- Why **smaller ions** with **higher charges** form **stronger ionic bonds** (like in lattice structures)
- How **isotopic mass** indirectly influences these forces by affecting atomic size and bond distance

## Summary

- Isotopes = same element, different mass
- Coulombâ€™s Law = force between charged particles
- Connection: Atomic radius (affected by isotopes) can influence electrostatic interactions governed by Coulombâ€™s Law
